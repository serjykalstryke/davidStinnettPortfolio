                Hello, My name is David Stinnett. I am a web developer, but my primary purpose in life is as a husband,
                father, and a provider for my family. I am attending the coding boot camp offered through the University
                of Richmond and have learned so much, and I cannot wait to learn more.
                <br><br>
                I am from the Richmond, Virginia area, and in my free time I enjoy playing music, coding and advocating
                for open source software
            </p>
